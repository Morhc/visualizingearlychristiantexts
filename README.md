# Visualizing Early Christian Writings

The website [Early Christian Writings](https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/) has a huge list of Christian writings before 400 AD with dates, but have you ever wondered what it might look like visualized as a timeline? Well fear no further and welcome to this repo.

### How To Use

Run ```python3 visualizer.py``` in your terminal and then open http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your browser.

### Version Controls

I made this in Python 3.9.6 and used the following packages:
- Pandas 2.2.1
- Plotly 6.0.1
- Dash 3.0.2

### TO-DO

- Dockerize this (at least what's needed for a virtual Python environment)
- Turn into an executable that works on Mac and Windows

### Caveats

I am not going to quibble with Peter Kirby's classifications or information. I am just going to take it as the gospel truth (>ᴗ•)... mostly. There are certainly date ranges that I do not agree with myself and a handful of texts that are plain medieval or later forgeries, but that's life. Don't trust this 100%!
